<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

##  About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is design inspired from this [ProCard | vCard HTML Template ðŸ”¥](https://themeforest.net/item/pro-card-material-cv-resume-vcard-template/20111046)

There are many great portfolio templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a portfolio template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating amazing projects rather than keep updating your portfolio code for the previous endeavour!

* This template allows you to edit your entire portfolio with just one file (`/src/data.js`) 

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
